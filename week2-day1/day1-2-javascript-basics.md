# [fit] Introduction to<br>JavaScript

---

# What is JavaScript?

- A client-side scripting language

- Meant to run entirely on the user's browser

- Defined by the ECMAscript standard, published by the ECMA foundation

- JavaScript != Java, they're completely different languages

---

# What is it used for?

- JavaScript allows you to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model), so you can do things like:

  - Showing and Hiding elements

  - Animating elements

  - Replacing elements with other elements

  - Making requests to the server without reloading the page

- The DOM is a programmatic representation of all of the HTML elements on the web page

---

## Example of JS functionality
#### Don't worry about comprehension, just an example of what JS can do

````js
function addNums(){
  num1 = document.getElementById('num1').value;
  num2 = document.getElementById('num2').value;
  document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = (parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2));
}
````

Necessary HTML

````html
Number 1: <input type="text" id="num1">
Number 2: <input type="text" id="num2">
<button id="add" onclick="addNums()">Click to add</button>
<br>
Result:
<span id="result">Result Here</span>
````
---

# Writing and running JavaScript - in a separate file, included

Use your text editor of choice to write `.js` files (for instance: `main.js` or `script.js`)

````js
// main.js
alert("Hello World");
````

Save them and include them in your HTML to run them

````html
<script src="main.js"></script>
````
---

# Writing and running JavaScript - in HTML file

You can also write JavaScript directly in your HTML:

````html
<head>
  <title>My Great JS example page</title>
  <script>
    alert('hi!');
  </script>
</head>
````

---

# Comments

There are two different ways to write comments in JavaScript:

````js
// This is a single line comment

/* I'm
a
nifty
multi-line
comment! */
````

Comments are a great way to stay organized and leave notes in your code as to exactly what you're trying to accomplish

Your goal is to write easily understandable code or comment enough to make your code clear to anyone reading it.

---

# Script Output - Why?

As you write JavaScript code, you'll need to periodically check that what your code returns is what you actually want it to return

---

# Script Output - How?

There are a few different ways to see the output of your script when you run it.

- **The Console** is a built-in tool in your browser where you can run JavaScript code directly. It also allows you to see the output of JavaScript you write in your editor

- **Alerts** are "pop-ups". You can see the output in a pop-up window as soon as the alert() function gets called

- **Logging to HTML** means to change the content of an HTML element with content of your choice, which could be script output

---

# Using the Console

- The JavaScript console can be opened in Google Chrome by using Command + Option + J (or Ctrl + Option + J on Windows machines)

- JavaScript can be run line by line inside of the console

- You can also output to the console inside of a .js file using:

````js
console.log("My Content");
````

---

# Using an Alert

To display an alert, use the `alert();` function. You can do it directly in the console or in a script (a `.js` file):

````js
alert("Hello World!");
````

---

# Logging directly to HTML

You can also change the "innerHTML" of any element, meaning what is contained inside of it:

````js
function change(){
  document.getElementById('myElement').innerHTML = "NEW TEXT";
}
````
````html
<div onclick="change()" id="myElement">CHANGE ME</div>
````

In the above example, we're changing the content of a <div> with the ID "el" from "CHANGE ME" to "NEW TEXT".

See the next slide for a line-by-line breakdown

---
# Asking for information from the user

There's one more special function in Javascript that's worth noting for educational purposes.

While you won't be using this in your day-to-day development life(I hope!), it will be useful today:

````js
  prompt('What is your name?');
````

prompt() creates an alert with an input, so that you can gather input from your user.
---

# Code Breakdown

````js
// Line 1: Declare a function called change
function change(){
// Line 2: Inside of the function, retrieve the current
// HTML document. Inside of that document, retrieve
// the element with the ID 'myElement' using the getElementById
// function. Set the content inside of the element to say
// "New Text".
  document.getElementById('myElement').innerHTML = "NEW TEXT";
// Line 3: Close the function.
}
// In your HTML document, you'll need a <div> with the ID
// "myElement". The onclick attribute allows you to specify a
// function to run when the element is clicked, in this
// case "change()"
<div onclick="change()" id="myElement">CHANGE ME</div>

````

---

# Your first JavaScript

- Create some JavaScript that sends an alert to the user that says "Hello World"

- Now, ask for your visitor's name!

- If you've got this down, try inserting "Hello World" into an element on screen instead

---

#[fit] Programming<br>Basics

What you'll need before you get to the "fun stuff"

---

# Data types in JavaScript

- Why are we putting any text being logged or alerted inside of quotes?

- By encapsulating our text in quotes, we are telling JavaScript the data inside is a string, a basic JavaScript data type

---

# Basic Data Types

- String - `"Hello World"`

- Number - `5`, `5.5`, `1000` (all numbers in JS are floats)

- Boolean - `true`, `false`

- `Undefined` (no value)

---

# Variables in JavaScript

- You may have learned about variables in a mathematical context, for instance:
  x = 0
  x + 10 = ?
  Answer: 10

- In JavaScript and in almost any programming language, a variable is simply a container for a value

---

# Variables in JavaScript

- JavaScript variables can be equivalent to any data type

- Variables are defined like so:

````js
  var name = "Zach";
  var numberOfWidgets = 10;
  var isCodingCool = true;
````

---

# Basic Math

JavaScript can do all basic math. For instance, you could run this code in the developer console:

````js
10 + 10;
> 20

var x = 100;
x * 40;
> 4000
````

---

# Further data types: Arrays

- Arrays are used to hold a collection of data, of any data type. This one is full of strings:

  ````js
  ["Snoopy", "Charlie Brown", "Patty", "Violet"];
  ````


- They can hold multiple data types:

  ````js
  [11, 15, 25, 48, 79, "elephant"];
  ````

- Arrays can also be stored in variables:

  ````js
  var classNames = ["Julie", "Sophie", "Rob", "John"];
  ````

---

# Accessing Array items - indexes

- Once you've declared an array, you may want to retrieve the items inside of it using their indices


- The index of an item inside of an array corresponds to its position from the beginning of the array

- The first item always has an index of 0

- In this array, "charlie brown" has the index of 0 and "snoopy" has the index of 1:

  ````js
  ["charlie brown", "snoopy"];
  ````

---

# A R R A Y C E P T I O N

An array can store other arrays:

````js
// declare the first array
var toyotas = ["Camry", "Prius"];
// declare the second array
var porsches = ["Camero", "Boxer"];
// declare a third array that contains the first
// and second array
var cars = [toyotas, porsches];
````

This is called a multi-dimensional array

---

# A R R A Y C E P T I O N

To access the items nested inside of a multi-dimensional array, you'll use this syntax:

````js
// declare your multi-dimensional array
var cars = [ ["Porsche", "Camero"], ["Camry", "Prius"] ];

// access the first array inside
// then the first item inside that array
console.log(cars[0][0]);

> "Porsche"

// access the first array inside
// then the first item inside that array
console.log(cars[1][0]);

> "Camry"
````

---

# Activity:

Create a multi-dimensional array with the first and last name of each person in the class as separate elements. Then, console.log only the first name of each class member.

# More data types: Objects

Kind of like arrays, but you define the keys:

```js
// Create an object with strings for keys
var car = {make: 'Toyota', model: 'Prius'};

// Pull out data with bracket notation
console.log(car['make']);

> "Toyota"
```

---

# Objects: dot notation

You can also use "dot notation" to get data out of an object

```js
// Create an array with strings for keys
var user = {firstName: 'Lucille', lastName: 'Bluth'};

// Pull out data using dot notation
console.log(user.firstName);

> "Lucille"
```

---

# A note on semicolons

- Semicolons are traditionally used to end statements in JavaScript

- Code will still execute without them

- They should be used to indicate the end of a statement and it's good form to include them

---

# In-Class Exercise #2

- Create a script with two variables assigned to two numbers. Add them together and output the result to the console

- Try to add two strings together and output the result to an alert

- Create an object that holds information about you. Include `firstName`, `lastName`, `birthday` and an array of `interests`. Print each property out to the console.
