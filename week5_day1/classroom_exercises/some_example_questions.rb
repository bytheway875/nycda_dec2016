# 1. Use Ruby to do the following math problems.

#   a = 5
#   b = 8
#   c = 12

#   d = a + b
#   e  = a + d
#   f = d + e

# Then, puts the value of 'f' to your terminal when you run the program!

# 2. Create an array of fruits.

# 3. Using the fruits from your fruits array as keys, create a hash that includes the fruits (keys) and their colors (values)!
